This is the README for the WiCS Website.

I was elected Webmaster of Women in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin before the Summer of 2014. The website at the time was really old and no one had really touched it in a few years. My job as newly elected Webmaster was to create a new website for the organization.

The website was created in about two weeks over the summer using HTML, CSS, and Twitter Bootstrap. At the time I did not know any of these skills and picked them up to complete this project. 

I was not able to run for webmaster for the 2015-2016 school year due to an internship during the Fall, so the code is now on github and is hosted on my website (www.juliemuzy.com) for people to see in action, if they wish.
